## 1.7 Matrices

### Matrix data

Matrices are just several vectors stored together. Here are three vectors:
```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 7, 9)
v2 <- c(2, 6, 3)
v3 <- c(8, 1, 4)
```

And we can create a matrix with the `matrix()` function:
```{r}
m<- matrix(c(v1, v2, v3), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
```

`matrix()` provides several options, including the number of rows (`nrow`) and constructing a matrix along rows or not (`byrow`):
```{r}
m2 <- matrix(c(v1, v2, v3), nrow = 3, byrow = FALSE)
```

Here, `m2` will construct the matrix along columns since `byrow` is set to `FALSE`. Note that this is the default behavior, unless you specify `byrow = TRUE`.

You can also use `cbind()` and `rbind()` to create matrices from other matrices:
```{r}
big_m <- cbind(m1, m2)
```

### Matrix dimensions

Functions that help with determining the size of matrices:
```{r}
length(big_m)
dim(big_m)
dim(big_m)[2]
nrow(big_m)
ncol(big_m)
```

#### Check your understanding

You have four vectors in your environment:
```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 1, 1)
v2 <- rep(2, 3)
v3 <- c(3, 3, 3)
v4 <- rep(4, 3)
```

You run the following line of code to create a matrix: (Note, you can't actually run this code!)

`my.matrix <- matrix(c(v1, v2, v3, v4), nrow = 4, byrow = FALSE)`

Describe the matrix that's formed here in words: 


### Indexing a matrix

Indexing a matrix by using the position of the row and the column to pick out an element: `m[row, column]`

```{r}
m[2, 3] # indexing the second row and third column number
m[1, ] # indexing row 1 (all elements)
m[ , 1] # indexing column 1 (all elements)
```

### Subsetting matrices

Similar to vectors, you can subset info in a matrix by specifing which row and/or columns you want.

```{r}
big_m[ , c(1, 3, 4)] # subsets just the first, third, and fourth columns
big_m[ , 1:4] # subsets the first through fourth columns
big_m[-1, ] # subsets everything BUT the first row
```


#### Check your understanding

You run the following line to create a matrix: 
```{r}
my_matrix2 <- matrix(seq(1, 21), nrow = 7, byrow = TRUE)
```

Write a line of code that will subset only two-digit numbers (or those greater than 9).
```{r}

```

### Multi-dimensional arrays

Arrays are `n`-dimensional and numeric, where `n` is any positive integer you specify.

Create a 3D array from three individual 2D matrices:
```{r}
m1 <- matrix(c(2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 1, 4, 7, 9), nrow = 3)
m2 <- matrix(c(1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 3, 8, 1, 4), nrow = 3)
m3 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 3, 9, 2, 1, 6, 2, 8), nrow = 3)

a1 <- array(c(m1, m2, m3), dim = c(3, 3, 3))
```

Using the `array()` function, you can specify the number of dimensions of the array by the number of positions in the `dim` vector. Here, it's not the number 3 that's specifying three dimensions, it's the fact there are *three* number 3's! Each number 3 specifies that each direction will have 3 spots.

### Indexing multi-dimensional arrays

Index arrays the same way as matrices, with the exception that there needs to be the same number of spots inside square brackets as there are dimensions in the array. For `a1`, it has three dimensions, so you need three spots:
```{r}
a1[ , , ]
```
The first spot are still rows, the second spot is still columns, and subsequent spots are the other dimensions. For `a1`, just capturing the last 2D matrix (`m3`) is: 
```{r}
a1[ , , 3]
```

You can check that this is the same as `m3` using `all.equal()`:
```{r}
all.equal(a1[ , , 3], m3)
```

#### Check your understanding

Which position in `a1` holds the value of 0?

Write the code here: 
```{r}

```

Which position in `a1` holds the value of 7?

Write the code here: 
```{r}

```
