## 1.8 Lists and Data Frames

### Data sets in base R

Base R comes with several sample data sets! To view, run:
```{r}
data()
```

To load a data set, such as the `BOD` data set, in RStudio's environment, you can use: 
```{r}
data("BOD")
force(BOD)
```
Load the following example data sets:
```{r}
# Example list data set:
data("ability.cov")
force(ability.cov)
# Example data frame data set:
data("ToothGrowth")
force(ToothGrowth)
```

### Creating and viewing lists

Create a list with the `list()` function:
```{r}
flop <- list(matrix(data = 1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2), c(T, F, T, T), "hello")
```

Inspect your list in RStudio using `View()`:
```{r}
View(flop)
```

The list `flop` has three __members__: (a matrix, a vector with four elements, and a vector with one element). 

### Member reference of lists

Reference a member of a list using double brackets: 
```{r}
flop[[3]] # third member of flop, the vector with one element
```

Adding single brackets with reference individual elements of the member:
```{r}
flop[[2]][2] # the second member of flop, the second element of that 4-member vector
flop[[1]][4] # the first member of flop, the fourth element of the matrix
flop[[1]][2,2] # same as previous line, using two position indexing
```

If you want multiple members of a list, you can perform list slicing by using single brackets with a vector: 
```{r}
flop[c(2, 3)] # cuts out the matrix
```
For easy reference, you can also name the members of your list: 
```{r}
names(flop) <- c("mymatrix", "mylogicals", "mystring")
```

Reference using a dollar sign: 
```{r}
flop$mylogicals
flop$mymatrix[1,1]
```

### List info

Information for lists is a bit different than for other classes. 

If you use `length()`, you will get the number of members:
```{r}
length(flop)
```

Most other functions will return `NULL` if you use them on lists: 
```{r}
dim(flop)
```

But you can use these on the individual members of the list like normal:
```{r}
dim(flop$mymatrix)
length(flop$mystring)
```

### Modifying lists

Add members to a list by assigning a new number or named member of the list with the assign arrow: 
```{r}
flop[[4]] <- c(3, 4, 7, 1, 10)
flop$blep <- "Haha"
```

#### Check your understanding

Create a list in which each member contains one of each data types you've learned so far in the course!

```{r}

```

### Creating Data Frames

Create a data frame using the function `data.frame()`:
```{r}
mydataframe <- data.frame(x = c(3.2, 5.4, 2.5, 4.4, 7.8), y = c(2.1, 1.0, 3.3, 2.9, 4.1), condition = c(T, F, T, T, F))
```

Rename columns using `colnames()`:
```{r}
colnames(mydataframe) <- c("up", "down", "cow")
```

You can also name the rows: 
```{r}
row.names(mydataframe) <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
```

### Indexing data frames

Rerun this line:
```{r}
mydataframe <- data.frame(x = c(3.2, 5.4, 2.5, 4.4, 7.8), y = c(2.1, 1.0, 3.3, 2.9, 4.1), condition = c(T, F, T, T, F))
```

Indexing data frames by the following methods: 
```{r}
mydataframe[2,3] # Index a position by row and column
mydataframe[["y"]] # Index by column name
mydataframe[["y"]][4] # Index by column name then row
mydataframe$y # Index by column name with dollar sign
mydataframe$y[4] # Index by column name with dollar sign then row
```

There a bunch more methods, which are useful in certain circumstances. See alignment chart. 

### Modifying data frames

Add a column by assigning it with a new name: 
```{r}
mydataframe$metric <- seq(1, 5)
```

Add multiple rows using "row bind" function `rbind()`:
```{r}
mydataframe <- rbind(mydataframe, mydataframe)
```

Add multiple columns using "column bind" function `cbind()`:
```{r}
mydataframe <- cbind(mydataframe, mydataframe)
```

### Info on data frames

Print out the first few lines: 
```{r}
head(ToothGrowth)
```

Print out the last few lines: 
```{r}
tail(ToothGrowth)
```

Print out a summary of columns of the data frame: 
```{r}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

#### Check your understanding

In the `ToothGrowth` data set, how can you print out all the measured tooth lengths from this study?

```{r}

```

How can you find the mean and standard deviations of these lengths?
```{r}

```


### Logical record subsets

Run the following line to create a matrix: 
```{r}
my_matrix2 <- matrix(seq(1, 21), nrow = 7, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix3 <- matrix(seq(1, 21), nrow = 7, byrow = FALSE)
```

This line of code will subset only two-digit numbers (those greater than 9):
```{r}
my_matrix2[4:7,]
```
This pulls the part of the matrix that only contains numbers greater than 9, but doesn't work for `my_matrix3` because it's constructed differently:
```{r}
my_matrix3[4:7,]
```

Another option is to use a logical record subset. This involves testing whether or not elements of the matrix are greater than 9: 
```{r}
my_matrix2 > 9
```
Positions where the elements are less than or equal to 9 are now `FALSE` where if they are greater than 9, they are `TRUE`. We can use this matrix to pull only the values that are true by using it inside square brackets: 
```{r}
my_matrix2[my_matrix2 > 9]
```

This method also works with `my_matrix3` since it doesn't rely on the positions of the numbers or how the matrix was constructed:
```{r}
my_matrix3[my_matrix3 > 9]
```

In data frames, you can find data associated with animals that were given orange juice (or `OJ`). First, find the rows in the column `supp` (or supplement) are equal to `OJ`:
```{r}
ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"
```

Now use this logical vector to retrieve the records from `ToothGrowth`:
```{r}
ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ",]
```

Note that the logical is being used in the row spot. If you forget the comma, you will get an error: 
```{r}
ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"]
```

No problem, just don't forget the comma! 


#### Check your understanding

In the `ToothGrowth` data set, how can you print out all the measured tooth lengths from their study that were only given a dose of 1.0?

```{r}

```

How can you find the mean and standard deviation of these lengths?
```{r}

```

Can you find the mean of tooth lengths for animals given an OJ does of 1.0?
```{r}

```
