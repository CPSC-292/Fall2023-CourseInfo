## 1.5 Data Types

R organizes different types of information in different types of objects. Each object has its own properties - you can perform different operations on it, perform different calculations, and it stores certain types of characters. 

In this lecture, we'll look at each of the core data types of R. Run each code chunk in this Rmd to reproduce code in the lecture. 

We already know how to assign information to objects in R:
```{r}
t <- 4
```

Here's a new way to assign, using the `assign()` function:

```{r}
assign("y", 8)
```

But this will not work: 
```{r}
assign(z, 8)
```

Why is this? Look at the help function: 
```{r}
?assign
```

Check the *class* of y:
```{r}
class(y)
```

### Numeric data class

Example code used in lecture: 
```{r}
x <- 1.44
class(1.44)
is.numeric(x)
y <- seq(1,4)
is.numeric("y")
```


### Integer data class

Example code used in lecture:
```{r}
is.integer(y)
is.integer(8)
is.integer(8L)
```

### Complex data class 

Example code used in lecture:
```{r}
dot <- 2 + 2i
is.complex(dot)
```

### Logical data class

Example code used in lecture:
```{r}
hop <- TRUE
is.logical(hop)
blip <- TRUE
blip <- T
# This will return an error:
#blip <- true 

is.logical(blip)
```

### Relational operators

Relational operators
```{r}
# Assigns value to a:
a = 3
# Relational operator equal to: 
a == 4
# Relational operator not equal to: 
a != 4
# Relational operator greater than: 
a > 4
# Relational operator less than: 
a < 4
```


### Logical Operators 

AND:
```{r}
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
```
OR:
```{r}
TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE
```

### Logicals as numerics

```{r}
foo <- seq(1, 5 , 0.5)
beep <- foo > 2
sum(beep)
```


#### Check your understanding

Will the following line of code work without error? 
```{r}
mean(c(T,F,F,F,T,T,T,F))
```

Write about the answer below.


### Replacement and indexing with logicals

```{r}
foo[beep]
anyvec <- c(3, 10, 12, 30, 45, 60)
anyvec[c(T,F,T,F,T,F)]
anyvec[c(T,F,T,F,T,F)] <- 0
anyvec
anyvec <- c(3, 10, 12, 30, 45, 60)
anyvec[c(T,F,T,F,T,F)]
```

ERROR IN LECTURE!! This is wrong!!!
```{r}
anyvec[-c(T,F,T,F,T,F)] <- 0 #WRONG!!!!
```
This is right! Use a ! instead of a -:
```{r}
anyvec[!c(T,F,T,F,T,F)] <- 0
anyvec
```

### Character data type


```{r}
blop <- "This is a string."
length(blop)

mynumber <- "35.4"
mynumber*2

my.string <- c("This", "is", "a", "string", ".")
my.string
length(my.string)
my.other.string <- paste(my.string[1], my.string[2], my.string[3], 
      my.string[4], my.string[5])
```

#### Check your understanding
Assign the following value to a: 
```{r}
a <- "y"
```

What class is object a and how can you test this to make sure? 

Write your code here:
```{r}

```

Write about how you know this: 

### Troubleshooting Corner

Annotate this section with your own notes: 
```{r}
b <- 2
b < 3
b < 3 & > 7 
```
Why does this fail and the following work? 
```{r}
b < 3 & b > 7
```

Why does this fail? How do you fix it?
```{r}
randos <- runif(10)
randos[>0.5]
sum(randos>0.5)
```
