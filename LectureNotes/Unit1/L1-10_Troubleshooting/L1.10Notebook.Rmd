## 1.10 Troubleshooting Problems

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Did you spell it correctly? 
```{r}
data("Loblolly")
View(Loblollly)
View(Lobolly)
View(Blololly)
View(Loblolly)
```

2. Is the capitalization/punctuation correct?
```{r}
Loblolly$Age
Loblolly$age
```

3. Is the syntax correct?
```{r}
d[ <- 3
d <- c(3, 5, 5
pop-v <- 4
3flips <- 3
```

4. Is the object in your environment?
```{r}
hop
```

### Splitting 

Practice splitting on these lines:
```{r}
data("Indometh")
mean(Indometh$conc[Indometh$time==8.00])
```
