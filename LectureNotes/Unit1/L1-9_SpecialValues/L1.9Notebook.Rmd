## 1.9 Factors, Special Values, & Class Coercion

### Factors

Factors are essentially a numeric with a unique label:

```{r}
colors <- c("white", "blue", "red", "blue", "red", "red")
color.fac <- factor(colors)
color.fac
as.numeric(color.fac)
```

Create factors with the `factor()` function: 
```{r}
pets <- factor(c("dog", "cat", "squirrel", "dog", "cat", 
                 "dog", "dog", "bear", "cat", "fish"))
```

You create the factor from a vector (only!). It will automatically assign the levels of the factor from the options in the vector. However, you can also assign specific levels using the `levels` argument:

```{r}
pets <- factor(c("dog", "cat", "squirrel", "dog", "cat", 
                 "dog", "dog", "bear", "cat", "fish"), 
               levels = c("dog", "cat", "fish", "bear", 
                          "squirrel", "wombat"))
```

Notice that now "wombat" is an option, even if it doesn't appear in the original vector. 

Factors can be unordered (like `pets`) or ordered using the `ordered` argument: 
```{r}
# ordered factor
pet_quality <- c("great", "good", "ok", "great", "good", 
                 "great", "great", "poor", "good", "ok")
pet_quality <- factor(pet_quality, ordered = TRUE, 
                      levels = c("poor", "ok", "good", 
                                 "great"))
```

The order of the levels can be set by the order of elements in the `levels` argument.

The `levels()` function can return the levels of a factor, and `nlevels()` will return just the number of levels:
```{r}
levels(pets)
nlevels(pets)
levels(pet_quality)
nlevels(pet_quality)
```

You can retrieve an individual element by indexing it like a vector: 
```{r}
levels(pets)[4]
```

You can test if a factor if ordered or unordered using `is.ordered()`:
```{r}
is.ordered(pets)
is.ordered(pet_quality)
```

#### Check your understanding

Create a data frame that contains: 

 - a column of class character describing something in your current surroundings
 - a column of class factor describing the color of those items
 
```{r}

```

### Special values

Here are the special values: 
```{r}
Inf
-Inf
NA
NaN
NULL
```
#### Check your understanding

What would you do in the following scenarios?

 - You have a data set in a data frame. It is very large, and you want to know whether or not it has missing data values. Youâ€™d also like to remove those values so that you only have a set of complete observations.
 
 - You have a data frame in which you use your own function with vectorized calculations. When you look at the output, it is NULL. What has happened? What should you do? 
 
 
### Class coercion

Lists are a special case since they are comprised of members of different classes. `as.list()` will coerce data into list form. `unlist()` will coerce list members into atomic vectors. 

```{r}
data("ability.cov")
unlisted.cov <- unlist(ability.cov)
```

Dates are kind of terrible in R, but here are a couple examples:
```{r}
date1 <- "2022/07/12 10:00:30"
new.date1 <- as.POSIXct(date1)
new.date2 <- as.POSIXlt(date1)
```


#### Check your understanding

Which command can accomplish the following coercions?

A logical vector into a numeric vector:
```{r}

```

A numeric vector into a character vector:
```{r}

```

Two vectors into a data frame:
```{r}

```

A list into a vector: 
```{r}

```
