## Skill Check 2.1 -- Geometric Object Types

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Loading required libraries
# Do not alter this section of code!
library(ggplot2)
```

For the next two class periods, you will work in a small group to prepare some sample code for using each of the following groups of geometric objects for your classmates: 

 1. `geom_point()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_qq_line()`
 2. `geom_bar()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_violin()`
 3. `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`, `geom_dotplot()` 
 4. `geom_map()`
 5. `geom_raster()`, `geom_tile()`, `geom_contour()`
 6. Other geoms: [ggplot extension gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)
 
Be ready to give a short presentation on each graph type. Let us know the following things: 

 * what does the plot look like (present an example of each)
 * what data are appropriate for use (categorical, continuous, etc)
 * what does the plot tell us about the data (generally)
 
Before class, you'll be responsible for turning in an R Markdown file with the example code as part of your Skill Check 2.1.
