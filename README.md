## About CPSC 292 

This course is intended to be a first programming course in R for students with no previous experience in computer programming. The course will focus on becoming familiar and functional in the R language using RStudio. We'll learn about objects, data classes and structures, basic programming features (scripting, functions, and flow control), and basic plotting using ggplot2. By the end of the course, students will be able to create simple scripts in R focused on basic data analysis and plotting in a way that is reproducible and replicable. 

The Course Learning Objectives are: 
 1. Understand the basic structure and function of the R programming language.
 2. Understand and follow best practices in scientific computing.
 3. Independently create and perform basic data analysis and visualization in a way that communicates ideas clearly.

## Before Class Starts

It will be useful to having R and RStudio installed and ready to go before class starts on Aug. 28th, 2023. Instructions are below! 

### Instructions for Installing Software

 - Install R: 
    1. Go to: https://cloud.r-project.org/ and select your operating system. IMPORTANT: If you have a Mac, you will need to select your processing chip architecture. See NOTE below.)
    2. Click on the latest release of R (it should be something like "R-4.3.1.pkg (notarized and signed)". 
    3. Open the downloaded pkg file and follow instructions to install. Please install R in the suggested, default location. 

 - Install RStudio (do so after installing R): 
    1. Go to: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download and select "Download RStudio Desktop". It should detect your operating system automatically. 
    2. Open the downloaded file and follow instructions to install.
  
  Note: To see if you have an Intel chip or an Apple Silicon M1/M2 chip, click the apple logo on the upper left corner of your screen, then "About This Mac." Then read the "Chip" entry on the popup window.

### Ordering a Textbook

We will be using _The Book of R_ by Tilman Davies (ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-651-5). You may be able to find an ecopy of this book, who knows! Maybe you should Google it.
