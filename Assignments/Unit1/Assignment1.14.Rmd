## Assignment 1.14 -- 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Do not alter this section of code!
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Write a R code in each chunk (gray space) that provides answers to the following questions. If any questions need direct answers, give them in regular text space (white space).

Each subpart of code below has at least one error. Correct each error, write a short explanation of your fix, and turn in the corrected version of this script. The script should run cleanly using "Source" in a clean working environment.
