## Assignment 1.9 -- Arrays

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Do not alter this section of code!
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Write a R code in each chunk (gray space) that provides answers to the following questions. If any questions need direct answers, give them in regular text space (white space).

### Question 1

*Create a three-dimensional array using `sample()` to generate data and store it in a variable called my3Darray. (The function `sample()` can be used to generate random whole numbers from a range you specify.) *

```{r}

```

*Use this array to answer the following questions.*

  a. *What dimensions are your 3D array?*
  
```{r}

```

  b. *How could you subset a part of your array to a single 2D matrix? Create a working example.*
  
```{r}

```

### Question 2

*Create a four-dimensional array using `sample()` to generate data and store it in a variable called my4Darray.*

```{r}

```

*Use this array to answer the following questions.*

  a. *What dimensions are your 4D array?*
  
```{r}

```
  
  b. *How could you subset a part of your array to a single 2D matrix? Create a working example.*
  
```{r}

```
  
  c. *How could you subset a part of your array to a single 3D array? Create a working example.*
  
```{r}

```
