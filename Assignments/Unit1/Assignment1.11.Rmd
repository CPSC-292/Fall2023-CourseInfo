## Assignment 1.11 -- Lists

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Do not alter this section of code!
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Write a R code in each chunk (gray space) that provides answers to the following questions. If any questions need direct answers, give them in regular text space (white space).

### Question 1

*What are the differences between lists and data frames? When is it best to use a list versus a data frame?*

Your answer here.

### Question 2

*Create a list named my.list that contains at least three members of three different data types/classes. Include the name in the next line so that R prints the list as output.*

```{r}

```

### Question 3

*Load the data set ability.cov and use it to perform the following:*

```{r}

```

  a. *Write a line of code that indexes the covariance value (cov) for maze and picture.*
  
```{r}

```
  
  b. *Write another line of code that indexes the covariance value for blocks and reading.*
  
```{r}

```
  
  c. *Subset the covariance value matrix (cov) so it shows only values associated with vocab.*
  
```{r}

```
