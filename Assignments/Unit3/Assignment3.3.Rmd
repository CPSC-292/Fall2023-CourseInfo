## Assignment 3.3

```{r, include=TRUE}
# Loading required libraries
 

```

### Question 1

*Write a set of conditional statements that will load a file in the `data/` folder based on the value of a number. The number and the value ranges are arbitrary. Do not use `switch()` for this question. Include at least four options. At the end, have the code plot two of the columns against each other using the column names and the `$` operator. *

```{r}


```


### Question 2

*Write a conditional using `switch()` that takes any input and does anything you'd like. A working example with four different options is all that's needed. Make it original!*

```{r, include=TRUE}
 
```
