```{r, include=TRUE}
# Loading required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

### Question 1

*Write a 200-word (approximately) that summarizes and briefly explains the three major takeaways from Lecture 2.6 How We See. Your summary should explain:*
 
 * *What are the three main takeaways*
 * *What part of the biology dictates why they work that way*
 * *How they impact the creation of good graphics*

Answer here.

### Question 2 

*On slide 33 of Lecture 2.6, there is a list of fast-processing features that can be used to distinguish data groups from each other. In three separate scatter plots graphing Sepal.Length versus Sepal.Width in the iris data set, create a demonstration of one fast-processing feature that distinguishes the different species from one another. You should have three separate plots, each showing a different fast-processing difference.*
