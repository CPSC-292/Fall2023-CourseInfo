library(viridis)

Be sure to write any regular text in the white space (not the gray code blocks).

### Question 1

*Text of question 1 *

Answer any questions that require text in the white space. And it's also useful to explain what your code is doing up here. Include any R code in chunks like below. (Note: this is not correct for this)
```{r, include=TRUE}
data("CO2")
plot(uptake ~ conc, data = CO2, col = viridis(2))
```

## Question 2

*text of question 2*

Your answer here. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
# More code!

```
